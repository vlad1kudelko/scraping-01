We are looking for a talented scraper expert who can develop for us a scraper with the following functionalities:

• All customer reviews and details of a specific listing (see details with all needed data attached)

A summary of the output here:
• Details to be collected per review as in the briefing attached:
o ID/Url of the review + aggregated rating
o Name of the writer
o Title of the review (if it exists)
o Content of the review (any language, not translated)
o Ratings (stars) and rating title
o Date of review (and response, if available)

• If there are owner-responses, they need to be scraped and linked to the review incl. date of the response + text + author

Development, ideally, in PHP (using symfony/dom-crawler and symfony/css-selector) but other languages also very welcome. Result should be in any case dockerized.

And it is important to use technology appropriately in order not to get blocked.

If the job is done and we both are happy with our partnership, there would be a couple of more jobs, similar to this one, to be done.
